# Low Level Design Patterns

Here's a list of some top low-level design patterns, which are often used to handle more specific, implementation-level concerns in software development. These patterns are generally more focused on solving particular, frequently occurring coding problems:

### 1. **Factory Method**
   - **Purpose:** Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
   - **Example Use Case:** When a class can't anticipate the class of objects it needs to create.

### 2. **Singleton**
   - **Purpose:** Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
   - **Example Use Case:** Managing resources such as database connections, logging, or configuration settings.

### 3. **Adapter**
   - **Purpose:** Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an incompatible class with a compatible interface.
   - **Example Use Case:** Integrating third-party libraries into your codebase without modifying the original code.

### 4. **Decorator**
   - **Purpose:** Adds new functionality to an object dynamically without altering its structure.
   - **Example Use Case:** Extending functionalities like logging, authentication, or validation on a per-object basis.

### 5. **Proxy**
   - **Purpose:** Provides a placeholder for another object to control access, manage resources, or add functionality.
   - **Example Use Case:** Implementing lazy loading, access control, or logging for objects that are expensive to create.

### 6. **Observer**
   - **Purpose:** Establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all dependents are notified and updated automatically.
   - **Example Use Case:** Implementing event handling systems, such as notifying subscribers of changes in real-time applications.

### 7. **Strategy**
   - **Purpose:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable to let clients choose the behavior at runtime.
   - **Example Use Case:** Selecting algorithms based on context, such as different sorting strategies or encryption algorithms.

### 8. **Command**
   - **Purpose:** Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, logging, or undoable operations.
   - **Example Use Case:** Creating a sequence of actions, such as implementing an undo-redo mechanism.

### 9. **Chain of Responsibility**
   - **Purpose:** Passes requests along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides to process the request or pass it along.
   - **Example Use Case:** Handling authentication, logging, or request validation.

### 10. **Template Method**
   - **Purpose:** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, letting subclasses redefine certain steps without altering the structure.
   - **Example Use Case:** Implementing a sequence of steps with common structure but specific details.

### 11. **Builder**
   - **Purpose:** Constructs complex objects step-by-step, allowing customization and reuse of the construction process.
   - **Example Use Case:** Constructing objects with multiple configurations or optional parameters, such as configuring a complex UI component.

### 12. **Prototype**
   - **Purpose:** Creates new objects by copying an existing object, rather than creating them from scratch.
   - **Example Use Case:** Duplicating objects where creating a new instance is resource-intensive.

### 13. **State**
   - **Purpose:** Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
   - **Example Use Case:** Implementing a finite-state machine where the objectâ€™s behavior varies according to its state, such as state transitions in UI components.

### 14. **Flyweight**
   - **Purpose:** Shares common parts of objects to reduce memory usage, especially when dealing with a large number of similar objects.
   - **Example Use Case:** Managing a large number of lightweight objects, like rendering a forest of trees in a game, where each tree shares the same structure.

### 15. **Mediator**
   - **Purpose:** Centralizes complex communications and control between related objects to reduce coupling.
   - **Example Use Case:** Implementing chat rooms, where each participant communicates via a central mediator.

These low-level patterns help improve code maintainability, flexibility, and reusability by offering solutions to common challenges in object-oriented design.
